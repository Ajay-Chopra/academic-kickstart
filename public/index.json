I am currently studying at UChicago pursuing two degrees in math and computer science. I originally entered college intending only to major in pure mathematics. However, in my second year I took an introductory computer science course and my love for tech and engineering was unlocked.\nAs a budding software engineer, my overarching goal is to build products that serve to improve the lives of the people who use them. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s cutting edge autonomous vehicle technology or a simple web app that reduces time spent doing tedious tasks, I always look forward to getting my hands dirty and doing the best work I can.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://Ajay-Chopra.github.io/author/ajay-chopra/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/ajay-chopra/","section":"authors","summary":"Hey there!
